# HLDA-WTMetaD-lasso
This repository has files for the Well-Tempered Metadynamics simulation of lasso peptides using HLDA CVs.
Download and extract the zip file. It should contain 3 folders:

* MccJ25
* Uln (Ulleungin)
* Sun (Sungsanpin)

Each folder contains the set of parameters necessary to start a simulation with each specific peptide.

The simulations were performed with Amber20 patched with PLUMED version 2.7.1
